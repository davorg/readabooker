<div class="biography">
<p>
Timothy Mo is a celebrated British novelist known for his compelling narratives and keen exploration of cultural and societal themes. Born in Hong Kong in 1950 to a Cantonese father and a British mother, Mo's bicultural heritage significantly influences his work, often centering on issues of ethnicity, identity, and the immigrant experience. He moved to England for his education, attending the prestigious Merton College at Oxford University, where he initially studied history.
</p>

<p>
Mo debuted as an author with "The Monkey King" in 1978, a novel that was highly acclaimed for its wit and richly drawn characters. His subsequent work, "Sour Sweet" (1982), further established his reputation, earning critical praise for its vivid portrayal of a Chinese family in London. Known for his incisive prose and ability to weave humor into complex narratives, Mo's writing continues to captivate and challenge readers. Despite his success, he is known for his independent stance, often shunning mainstream publishing houses to maintain creative control. Timothy Mo remains an influential figure in contemporary literature, with his novels continuing to resonate with audiences around the world.</p>
