<div class="biography">
<p>
Anthony Burgess, born John Anthony Burgess Wilson on February 25, 1917, in Manchester, England, was a prolific and versatile British writer and composer. Raised in a working-class Catholic family, his early life was marked by the loss of his mother and sister to the 1918 influenza pandemic. Burgess attended the University of Manchester, where he studied English literature and phonetics.
</p>

<p>
Before achieving fame as a novelist, Burgess worked as a lecturer in speech and drama, and served in the British Army during World War II. His time in the army and subsequent experiences in Malaya with the British Colonial Service greatly influenced his writing.
</p>

<p>
Burgess became a household name with his dystopian novel "A Clockwork Orange" (1962), which explored themes of free will and the nature of evil. The novel's innovative use of language and its dark themes cemented his reputation as a daring and insightful writer.
</p>

<p>
Throughout his career, Burgess wrote more than 30 novels, as well as essays, plays, and musical compositions. His works often exhibited a mastery of language, inventive narratives, and satirical wit. Burgess passed away on November 22, 1993, in London, leaving behind a legacy that continues to influence writers and readers worldwide.</p>
