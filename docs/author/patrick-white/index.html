<div class="biography">
<p>
Patrick White was an influential Australian novelist, playwright, and poet, widely regarded as one of the most significant literary figures in the 20th century. Born on May 28, 1912, in London, England, White spent much of his early life in Australia and later studied at King's College, Cambridge. Throughout his career, he wrote a number of acclaimed novels, including "The Tree of Man," "Voss," and "The Eye of the Storm," which not only established him as a pivotal figure in Australian literature but also gained him international recognition.
</p>

<p>
White's writing often delves into themes of identity, isolation, and the human connection to the Australian landscape. He was known for his complex characters, rich prose, and profound philosophical insights. In 1973, he received the Nobel Prize in Literature, making him the only Australian author to have been awarded this honor. Patrick White continued to write prolifically until his death on September 30, 1990. His legacy endures, influencing both readers and writers across the globe with his unique literary voice and contribution to modern literature.</p>
