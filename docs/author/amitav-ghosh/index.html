Amitav Ghosh, born on July 11, 1956, in Calcutta, India, is a distinguished author and academic recognized for his profound narratives and exploration of historical themes. Educated at The Doon School, Ghosh went on to earn degrees from St. Stephen's College, Delhi University, and furthered his studies at the University of Oxford, where he completed a D.Phil. in social anthropology. His literary career took off with his debut novel, "The Circle of Reason," in 1986. Ghosh's work is characterized by its intricate fusion of history, cultural anthropology, and nuanced storytelling, as seen in acclaimed novels such as "The Shadow Lines," "The Glass Palace," and the Ibis Trilogy, which delves into the opium trade of the nineteenth century. His prose often tackles complex topics like colonialism, migration, and identity, woven with rich historical detail. Ghosh has been recognized globally, receiving numerous awards for his contributions to literature. Besides writing, he has also been involved in teaching and academic pursuits across prestigious institutions worldwide.
