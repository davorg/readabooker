            <p>The Booker Prize is one of the richest literary prizes
              in the English-speaking world.</p>
            <p>Each year, a prize of £50,000 is awarded to the best novel
              of the year written in English and published in the UK
              or Ireland.</p>
            <p>The International Booker Prize was started in 2005 to reward
              books that were translated into English and published in the
              UK or Ireland.</p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">Name and sponsorship</h2>
            <p>The Booker Prize was created in 1969. It was named after Booker McConnell Ltd
              (now just known as <a href="https://www.booker.co.uk/">Booker Group</a>) its
              original sponsor.</p>
            <p>From 2002 to 2019, it was known as the "Man Booker Prize" after its new sponsor,
              <a href="https://www.man.com/">Man Group</a>. In 2019, the current sponsor,
              <a href="https://crankstart.org/">Crankstart</a> was announced.</p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">The Lost Booker</h2>
            <p>In the first two years of the competition, the prize was open to books
              published the year before the prize was awarded. In 1971, this was
              changed to the same year as the prize ceremony. This effectively meant
              that books published in 1970 were not considered for an award.</p>
            <p>In 2010 a special "Lost Booker" competition was announced for books
              published in 1970. From a long list of 22 novels, the judges chose
              <i>Troubles</i> by J. G. Farrell as the winner.</p>
